## User panel

# We can create a webpage with a sidebar or navbar containing the following sections: Dashboard, Assignment, Learn, Notes, Doubts, and Test.

# Dashboard: Displays DPI, subject-wise progress, and pending assignments.Pending assignments are color-coded based on deadlines-red for 1 day remaining, orange for 2 days, and so on. When a user clicks on an assignment, it opens in the Assignment section, where they can write their response.

# Doubts: Users (trainees) can ask subject-wise doubts. If a TA responds, the doubt appears in green; otherwise, it remains orange.

# Assignments: Displays both active and expired assignments. Active assignments are color-coded according to their deadlines. This section includes a built-in compiler. Expired assignments are also color-coded-green if completed and grey if not. While working on assignments, users can take notes to document new learnings. They can also set the importance level of these notes.

# Test: Allows users to take tests.

# Learning: Displays notes uploaded by TAs. Users can search for information, with results fetched from the TCS IRC database.

# Notes: Shows all previously created user notes. Users can filter notes by subject and importance.
